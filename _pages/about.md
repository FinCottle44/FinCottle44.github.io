Hi, my name is Fin Cottle. I'm a Computer Science graduate that loves music, snowboarding & everything technology. This website is a way for me to show you what I can do for you, as well as tell you a little bit about myself.

I grew up in Bristol, which I'd argue is the best city in the country. Bristol is famous for being quite a musical city and I got the music bug myself. I started off selling rap instrumentals on YouTube from my bedroom, which has now led to me charting Number 1 in the Official UK Album charts and gaining almost 10 million streams and counting on my music!
I also worked in Austria for a year doing a ski-season before going to Cardiff University (pictured) to study Computer Science. I met some great people in Cardiff, which I'd also argue is the second-best city in the UK...

You may have found yourself on my website looking for help with cloud solution design or software development services and if so, you came to the right place! As you can see in my projects, I'm working on a start-up called Automora with a couple of my friends & its going pretty well, but as my time is freeing up, I'm keen to work with other companies or projects to consult or remediate where I can. Consultation I've provided to some other companies is outlined in the testimonials section of my home page, where you can see my experience is vouched for. 

I learnt so much developing Automora regarding cloud computing, distributed computing & technology as a whole that I feel I have a lot of insight to provide. I am an experienced Python developer, whether it is data analysis notebooks or APIs, I've probably done it. Again, whilst this startup is getting up and running, I'm offer out this experience to companies that need software done. I'm about to start some web development work for a company & I'm keen to show them what I can provide.

So that's a little bit about me. Please don't hesite to reach out if you can see us working together on anything large or small, I'd love to be a part of whatever it is.
