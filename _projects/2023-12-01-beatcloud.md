Music producers face enough hardship as it is, working in such a cut-throat industry. One thing that would make the musician lifestyle vastly easier is having a tool that allows you to worry less about marketing your creations. BeatCloud is that tool.

A huge amount of music producers market themselves on YouTube, especially in the hip-hop/rap scene. This can be very effective but it takes a lot of time and resources to create the videos to market the audio. Because of this producers lose motivation and passion to do what they love. I know this exact feeling too well, so I decided to do something about it.

BeatCloud is a tool for music producers to make these high-quality, effective videos without taxing their computer's resources or taking up a load of their valuable time. Users log on, upload a base video or image and can load custom presets to define the look of their video and push it straight to YouTube, hugely reducing time spent on the tedious side of their job, such as export or upload times.

BeatCloud was built using a diverse set of technologies, it uses bootstrap css & jquery for the front end alongside FFMPEG, Python (Flask & Celery) and runs on AWS using DynamoDB, S3 & Fargate. This was originally a tool to help me, which now helps many others aswell!
