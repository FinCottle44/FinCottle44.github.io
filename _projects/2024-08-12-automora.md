Prestigious car dealerships around the world rely on third parties to touchup images of their vechicles with long turnaround times of sometimes over 48hrs. My friend Ben came to me with this problem and we came up with Automora. Automora allows the editing to be done in-house, quickly, saving huge amounts of time and money by getting cars to market quickly.

We've reduced the average turnaround time from 24-48 hours to under 10 minutes by utilising machine learning models and computer vision techniques to perform all the changes and edits that would've been done using one of these third parties, but much quicker. 
Automora features background replacement, auto-centering & resizing of the subject, object & blemish detection and removal in the road surface, AI advert description generation, placeholder video creation & more.

Automora is built mainly using Python, making use of libraries such as Celery for distributed computing and Flask for an internal API running on AWS Fargate & EC2. We are also working on a public facing API built using Amazon's API Gateway and other similar technologies. If you need any assistance using cloud technologies or constructing any similar applications, don't hesitate to get in touch.
