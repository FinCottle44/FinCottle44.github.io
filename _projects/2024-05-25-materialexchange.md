At the start of 2024 a company came to me with a few problems with their site Material Exchange. Material Exchange is a brilliant concept, but when it came to developing it the original company underperformed.

Material Exchange was built on Bubble.io, a no-code site for building web-applications. Originally I was brought on to remediate bugs and design flaws in the system, however, I have now been kept on to implement new features & functionality, whilst continuing to fix old problems.

I have built MX an inventory management system for their larger construction company clients, allowing them to share resources between all of their projects via an intuitive user interface, instead of a spreadsheet! MX have been really happy so far with my work, as shown in the testimonials on my home page. If you need any remedial work like this done, don't hesitate to get in touch.
