Being a rap producer in the UK is a rollercoaster ride that not everyone can handle. It's a dream many chase, but few truly understand the sacrifices involved. I’ve been fortunate enough to chart number 1 with D Block Europe, and my tracks have racked up almost 10 million streams. I’ve worked with some of my favorite artists, those I grew up admiring, which has been both a surreal and gratifying experience.

But let me tell you, the journey to these achievements has been far from glamorous. The music industry, particularly the rap scene, is riddled with challenges that most outsiders aren’t privy to. You might think that chart-topping hits and millions of streams translate to a healthy bank account, but the reality is often quite the opposite.

Royalties, for one, are notoriously difficult to track. Even when you do manage to get what you're owed, it’s often far less than expected. The payment structures are opaque, and the system is designed in a way that benefits the top-tier artists and labels more than the producers who craft the beats. It’s not uncommon to find yourself chasing down payments that should have been straightforward, dealing with accountants and legal teams more often than you’d like.

Another harsh truth is that, in this industry, the power dynamics are skewed. Rappers and artists know that as a producer, you need them more than they need you. This often leads to situations where payments are delayed, or worse, never come through. There's a level of fakeness that permeates the industry—people who once called you a "bro" suddenly go silent when it's time to settle their dues.

But amidst all this, there are moments that make it worthwhile—those late-night studio sessions with friends, turning ideas into tracks that resonate with listeners around the world. The joy of creating something meaningful with your idols, the artists who inspired you to start producing in the first place, is an unparalleled experience.

However, if I'm being honest, these highs are increasingly overshadowed by the lows. The constant struggle for recognition, fair compensation, and dealing with the industry's toxic culture has made me question whether it’s all worth it in the long run. There’s something soul-crushing about putting your heart and soul into a project only to see it undervalued and underappreciated.

The music industry, especially the rap scene, can be a harsh environment. It's a place where your passion is both your driving force and your greatest vulnerability. For every beat that makes it to the top of the charts, there’s an untold story of struggles, sacrifices, and the constant battle to stay afloat.

As I continue on this journey, I’m left contemplating the future. The excitement of making music is still there, but so is the weight of everything that comes with it. For those thinking of stepping into this world, my advice is simple: know your worth, and be prepared for a ride that’s as challenging as it is rewarding.
